Let's re-organise the red tweezers engine a little bit.  Focus on our core competencies and all that.  Presently, we do:

x,y,z, l,phi,intensity for each spot
restriction of each spot to a specific region on the back aperture (nax,nay,nar)
zernike modes (first 15 coefficients, minus tip,tilt and piston=12 modes) either per-spot or globally
line traps, with a generalised line vector in 3D and a specified phase gradient
amplitude shaping (presently just by graying out), mostly to support the line traps

The core engine should:
set up the useful geometry parameters (focal length, SLM size, etc. etc.)
create a basic hologram, with x,y,z,l, phase and intensity for each spot.
handle the output, possibly with blazing.

we should then be able to switch features on and off, for example NA control, line traps, per-trap Zernike modes, amplitude shaping

or do we want to keep it simpler than this???
